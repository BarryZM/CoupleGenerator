I'm surprised so many friends are interested in this toy project. 
I saw some friends on Weibo who said that the training results were not good.
Here is the results after 8800 steps.




Generate your lover with your photo
This project is an old project from two years ago. 
We collect pictures of marriage couples on the Internet, and pre-process the images.
The model was trained by using the code of pix2pix.

An example of training images:

The model can fit the training images in a short time. 

You can make photos of yourself with the person you loved as a training pair~

This repo is just for entertaments.
If you have any interests, please feel free to use the code and the dataset.
